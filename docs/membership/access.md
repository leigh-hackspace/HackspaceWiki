# Access to the Hackspace

Due to current limitations we're unable to offer 24/7 access for general members, and responsibility for opening the space is delegated to a few key holders. We intend to solve this once we've implemented a door access system for the space.

For current opening times please consult the [website](https://leighhack.org) or ask on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/leighhack/shared_invite/enQtNDYzMjEyMDMxNDExLTE1MWY5N2IwMzdhMzQ0ZWFiNDkyNzJmMGM1ZmFkODcwMGM5ODFmYmI4MjhmM2JiMWEyY2E3NTRjMTQzMzljZWU).
