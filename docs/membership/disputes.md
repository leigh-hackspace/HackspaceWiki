# Disputes

Leigh Hackspace is a community built on respect, collaboration, and mutual understanding. We believe that everyone has the right to work in a positive and supportive environment. In the event of a dispute, we encourage open dialogue and peaceful resolution. However, we understand that conflicts can sometimes escalate and need formal intervention.

In such cases, disputes will be handled directly by the Leigh Hackspace directors. They will take an unbiased and careful approach to understand the situation, speak to all parties involved, and find a fair resolution. The directors have the community's best interests at heart and will always strive to maintain a positive and productive environment for everyone.

If you're facing a dispute, don't hesitate to reach out. Our directors are here to help and ensure that Leigh Hackspace remains a welcoming and harmonious place for all its members.
