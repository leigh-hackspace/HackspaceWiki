# Becoming A Member

## Initial Tour

It is advised that you visit the hackspace and receive a tour, this will give you a quick overview of the spaces available to members, and showcase any projects we're working on as a collective.

At the moment, tours operate on a **Saturday afternoon**, but for the latest information check the [website](https://leighhack.org).

## On-boarding

To become a member you are required to sign-up for payment via Direct Debit using the website. Please review the [membership types](membership_types.md), and if you have any questions please get in contact.

No further action is currently required, but this may change in the future. Make sure you provide a valid email address as part of the registration with GoCardless to ensure you receive notifications.
