# Becoming A Member

## Initial Tour

It is advised that you visit the hackspace and receive a tour, this will give you a quick overview of the spaces available to members, and showcase any projects we're working on as a collective.

At the moment, tours operate on a **Saturday** from **12pm to 1pm**, but for the latest information check the [website](https://leighhack.org).

## On-boarding

To become a member you are required to sign-up for payment via Direct Debit using the website. Please review the [membership types](membership_types.md), and if you have any questions please get in contact.

No further action is currently required, but this may change in the future. Make sure you provide a valid email address as part of the registration with GoCardless to ensure you receive notifications.

## Introductions

We suggest that after you have become a member join the [Slack](https://leighhack.slack.com/archives/C0A9Y6H26) community, this will help you to get to know the other members and possibly connect you to other like-minded users of the hackspace. As most activity in the hackspace is community driven it can be quite difficult to get involved at first. If you have a particular area of interest it may be work dropping a message to the [area specific contact](useful_contacts.md#area-specific-contacts).

## Inductions

At the moment we have no formal induction process, but this will be changing soon. If you wish to use a specific tool it may be worth dropping a message to a [area specific contact](useful_contacts.md#area-specific-contacts) to understand what is required.
