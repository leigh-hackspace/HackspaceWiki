# Code of Conduct

Leigh Hackspace is a shared community workspace that offers the 
facilities needed to make a variety of projects for locals that don’t 
have the accessibility at home. We provide inspiration, equipment, 
ideas, support, training and even some materials for ‘hacking’. All 
with a great community spirit and a ‘can-do’ atmosphere. 

We have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This 
code applies equally to members, volunteers and guests.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can or can't do. 
Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it 
easier to enrich all of us, our projects, and the broader communities 
in which we participate. 

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Leigh 
Hackspace. This includes, but not limited to, Leigh Spinner Mill, 
social platforms, events, mailing lists and any other forums created 
by the project team which the community uses for communication. 
In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a 
person's ability to participate within them. 

* **Be friendly and patient**. 
* **Be kind**
* **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes 
and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This 
includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, 
culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and 
economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, 
gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, 
political belief, religion, and mental or physical ability. 
* **Be considerate.** You will be working in a communal space, 
and you in turn will be responsible for cleaning up after 
yourself. This includes storage of projects within the 
Hackspace. Projects must be stored within the dedicated 
spaces. If left out, Hackspace holds the right to relocate 
projects to an area where they are not in the way of others. 
* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but 
disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor 
manners. We might all experience some frustration now and 
then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a 
personal attack. It's important to remember that a community 
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a 
productive one. Members of the community should be 
respectful when dealing with other members as well as with 
people outside the community. 
* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** Be kind to others. 
Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and 
other exclusionary behaviour aren't acceptable. This includes, 
but is not limited to: 
  * Violent threats or language directed against another 
  person. 
  * Discriminatory jokes and language. 
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material. 
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally 
  identifying information ("doxing"). 
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist 
  terms. 
  * Unwelcome sexual attention. 
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above 
  behavior. 
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone 
  asks you to stop, then stop. 
* **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, 
both social and technical, happen all the time and the 
Hackspace community is no exception. It is important that we 
resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. A 
strength of Hackspace is the varied community, people from a 
wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different 
perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why 
someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. 
Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other 
doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve 
issues and learning from mistakes.

See the [GNU Kind Communications Guidelines](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.en.html) for more guidance 
on constructive interactions.
