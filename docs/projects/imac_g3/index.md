### Accessories

No matching accessories, the hackspace has a Apple keybord and puck mouse but its not original to the Blueberry G3.

## Current Issues

* **Slot Loader fails** - The CD drive is temperamental, pushing the disk in forcedly works every time, but ejection can take 5-10 attempts. The more attempts seem to improve the response of the time. Suspecting that its gummed up with something.

## Resolved Issues

* Messed up OS9 installed fixed with a fresh install
* CRT blue tint resolved with some power on hours, didn't recur.

## Documentation

* [Service Manual](iMac_DV.pdf)
