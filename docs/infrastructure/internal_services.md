# Internal Services

The hackspace runs a collection of services on the hackspace network, either to assist with automation or just to be useful for members.

## Filestore

Filestore is a generic, web-accessible filestore system that is available on all segments of the network.

## MQTT

We have a MQTT server available, at `mqtt.int.leighhack.org`. At the moment this service is unauthenticated, but in the future it'll require a login and possibly TLS client certs.

Hostname: `mqtt.int.leighhack.org`
Port: `1883`
