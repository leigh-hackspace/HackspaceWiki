# VPN

Leigh Hackspace offers a VPN service to its members, this allows you connect to hackspace internal services while outside of the space itself. 

We currently use OpenVPN, so on Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS you can use the native packages, and on macOS we suggest [Viscosity](https://www.sparklabs.com/viscosity/).

## Requirements

You'll need an account on [id.leighhack.org](https://id.leighhack.org). Ideally, sign up with the same email address that you used for your GoCardless membership. Once created you'll need to ask in [#infra on slack]() to get added to the correct group.

## Configuration

These config files should enable you to configure and connect with a click of a button:

* [VPN Configuration](vpn/members-vpn.ovpn)
* [VPN Configuration for older OpenVPN versions](vpn/members-vpn-old.ovpn)

## Access

This VPN will give you access the same as being on the WiFi within the hackspace. If you have any specific requirements you need from the VPN then contact Infra.
