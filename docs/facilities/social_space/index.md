# Social Space

Welcome to The Social Space, our inviting social hub furnished with comfortable seating and a service area for soft drinks. More than just a relaxation spot, Social Space also functions as an event venue, complete with a stage for performances, presentations, or gatherings.

## Game Consoles

In the corner we have a collection of consoles and games. Currently we have:

* Sony PS2
* Microsoft Xbox 360
* Nintendo Wii

## Garden

We have a small garden area at the back of the social space that we try to grow some chillies and other plants. In the future we're hoping to create a automated hydroponics setup.
