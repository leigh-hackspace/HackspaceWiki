# Artist Pods

Our Artist Pods offer individual, partitioned spaces for lease by makers and artists looking for a dedicated area to create and innovate. Conveniently located in an open area, the pods share proximity with the [Fabrication](fabrication.md), [Workshop](workshop/index.md), and the [Wet Area](wet_area.md), offering easy access to a range of resources.

Interested in a personal creative space within Leigh Hackspace? Feel free to reach out to one of our [directors](../membership/useful_contacts.md#directors) for further information on renting an Artist Pod.
