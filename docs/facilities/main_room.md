# Main Room

Our Main Room serves as the heart of Leigh Hackspace, providing the most generous area for general use, and currently housing our dedicated [Electronics zone](electronics.md).

Please note that the layout and usage of the Main Room is currently in a state of flux. Currently, it is functioning as our primary storage area, temporarily housing various items until we designate more suitable locations. We appreciate your understanding as we work to enhance the space.
