# Vinyl Cutters

We have 1 vinyl cutter availble for all members to use.

The vinyl cutter is attached to CAD-1, and works with [InkCut](https://github.com/inkcut/inkcut).  Inkcut will cut your SVG designs.

Workflow:

* Transfer your SVG file to CAD-1.
* Turn on the vinyl cutter.
* Open Inkcut, and load your SVG file.
* Check the dimensions of your SVG file.
* Load vinyl in to the vinyl cutter.  If error is displayed, the lever is probably up.
* Blade pressure is imporant.  See the section on test cuts and pressure.
* Send file to printer.

Test Cuts and Pressure:

*  The pressure should be pre-set for thin vinyl.  
*  When first coming to the printer and printing with a new sheets, it's imporant to perform a test cut before cutting your own design.
*  Start with the lightest pressure, and add more pressure until you make a good cut.  Add no more pressure.
