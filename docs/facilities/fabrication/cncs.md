# CNCs

We have 1 CNC available for all members to use after training.

The CNC has an attached Raspberry Pi console, and we ask that you transfer your files locally to CNC-1 before use.

> You are responsible for ensuring the safe operation of CNCs.  
> Do not leave CNCs unattended.
> CNCs are easy to damage through improper use.
> If you are in doubt about the operation of CNCs, please ask, and 
> someone will be happy to help.

Workflow:

There's a number of repeatable steps to cutting on our CNCs.  
It's also a bit more complicated.  
When we work it out, we'll let you know...
