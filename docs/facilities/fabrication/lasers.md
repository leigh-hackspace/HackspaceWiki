# Lasers

We have 1 laser engraver/cutter available for all members to use after training.

The laser engraver is networked, and we ask that you use the linked [LaserWeb](https://laserweb.yurl.ch/) server when running your files.

> You are responsible for ensuring the safe operation of lasers.  
> Do not leave lasers unattended.
> Do not operate lasers without the safety cover in place.
> If you are in doubt about the operation of lasers, please ask, and 
> someone will be happy to help.

Workflow:

There's a number of repeatable steps to engraving/cutting on our lasers.  
We're hoping that everyone can follow them and have a consistent experience.

* You will need a SVG or PNG/JPG to upload to cut/engrave.
* Open LaserWeb for the Laser.
* Turn on the laser cutter.
* Drag your image in to LaserWeb, resize and place in the bottom left of the laser bed.
* [Set tool paths for the parts of your image.  See the settings for the laser.](https://urbanmakerkraft.com/2022/02/04/guide-laserweb-01-basic-setup-and-gcode-generation/)
* Connect to the laser, clear any errors, and nudge the printer to the bottom left corner.  Take 
care to not hit the frame.
* When you are over the bottom left corner, set 0,0.
* Nudge the head far enough away to place your work piece.
* **Important** close the laser shield.
* Start the laser.  Do not open until the work is complete.  If a problem occurs, cancel in LaserWeb.
* Nudge the head to allow you to remove your piece.

## Laser-1 - Laser Engraver

Laser-1 is a custom laser engraver with a low powered laser capable of engraving in wood and plastics, leather and cutting paper and card.

Laser-1 will cut from vector and bitmap graphics using [LaserWeb](https://laserweb.yurl.ch/)

* Laser-1 has no automatic home and **must be manually homed** before every use.
* Laser-1 **must** have it's safety cover in place before the laser is turned on.
