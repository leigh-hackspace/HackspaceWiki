# Welcome

Leigh Hackspace is a maker community and makerspace open to all creatives, programmers and hackers in the North West. Simply put, itâ€™s a social workspace where you are free to use the tools and facilities we provide to build, make, and create whatever you like.

We also host a number of events and workshops, as well as offering private artist studios and a shared co-working area.
