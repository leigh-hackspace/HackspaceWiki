We provide inspiration, equipment,  ideas, support, training and even some materials for \u2018hacking\u2019. All  with a great community spirit and a \u2018can-do\u2019 atmosphere. </p> <p>We have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This  code applies equally to members, volunteers and guests.</p> <p>This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can or can't do.  Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it  easier to enrich all of us, our projects, and the broader communities  in which we participate. </p> <p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Leigh  Hackspace. This includes, but not limited to, Leigh Spinner Mill,  social platforms, events, mailing lists and any other forums created  by the project team which the community uses for communication.  In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a  person's ability to participate within them. </p> <ul> <li>Be friendly and patient. </li> <li>Be kind</li> <li>Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes  and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This  includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity,  culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and  economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation,  gender identity and expression, age, size, family status,  political belief, religion, and mental or physical ability. </li> <li>Be considerate. You will be working in a communal space,  and you in turn will be responsible for cleaning up after  yourself. This includes storage of projects within the  Hackspace. Projects must be stored within the dedicated  spaces. If left out, Hackspace holds the right to relocate  projects to an area where they are not in the way of others. </li> <li>Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but  disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor  manners. We might all experience some frustration now and  then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a  personal attack. It's important to remember that a community  where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a  productive one. Members of the community should be  respectful when dealing with other members as well as with  people outside the community. </li> <li>Be careful in the words that you choose. Be kind to others.  Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and  other exclusionary behaviour aren't acceptable. This includes,  but is not limited to: </li> <li>Violent threats or language directed against another    person. </li> <li>Discriminatory jokes and language. </li> <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material. </li> <li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally    identifying information (\"doxing\"). </li> <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist    terms. </li> <li>Unwelcome sexual attention. </li> <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above    behavior. </li> <li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone    asks you to stop, then stop. </li> <li>When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements,  both social and technical, happen all the time and the  Hackspace community is no exception. It is important that we  resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. A  strength of Hackspace is the varied community, people from a  wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different  perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why  someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong.  Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other  doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve  issues and learning from mistakes.</li> </ul> <p>See the GNU Kind Communications Guidelines for more guidance  on constructive interactions. </p> <p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that  you report it by emailing info@leighack.org. </p>"},{"location":"membership/code_of_conduct/#questions","title":"Questions?","text":"<p>If you have questions, please feel free to contact us. </p> <p>Text derived from the GCC project Code of Conduct, used under  the Creative Commons Attribution license.</p>"},{"location":"membership/disputes/","title":"Disputes","text":"<p>Leigh Hackspace is a community built on respect, collaboration, and mutual understanding.
